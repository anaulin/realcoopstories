  Welcome to Real Co-op Stories, a podcast where cooperative workers tell
  their stories, along the way answering questions like:
  <p>
  How is the day-to-day in a co-op? How did you get started? Did you get
  initial funding? How do you make decisions? How does it compare to
  non-cooperative work? What challenges have you faced?
