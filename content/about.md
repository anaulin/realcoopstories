Real Co-op Stories is a series of conversations with practitioners of the democratic economy. These conversations aim to shine a light on the real-world experiences of those involved in cooperatives, and to provide inspiration and resources to those who want to join the democratic economy.

This podcast hosted by [Ana Ulin](https://anaulin.org), a software engineer whose search for better ways of working together has taken her down the democratic workplace rabbithole. Listen to Ana's introduction to Real Co-op Stories in [the first episode]({{< ref "episode/ep-0-introduction-and-welcome.md" >}}).
