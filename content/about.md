Real Co-op Stories is a series of conversations with practitioners of the cooperative economy. These conversations aim to shine a light on the real-world experiences of those involved in cooperatives, and to provide inspiration and resources to those who want to join the democratic economy.

These conversations are hosted by [Ana Ulin](https://anaulin.org), a software engineer whose search for better ways of working together has taken her down the democratic workplace rabbithole. Listen to Ana's introduction to Real Co-op Stories in [Episode 0: Introduction]({{< ref "episode/ep-0-introduction-and-welcome.md" >}}).

You can learn more about Ana on her website, [anaulin.org](https://anaulin.org). Get in touch on Mastodon at [@anaulin@social.coop](https://social.coop/@anaulin), on Twitter at [@anaulin](https://twitter.com/anaulin), or via email at ana@ulin.org.
