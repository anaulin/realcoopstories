Real Coop Stories is a collection of conversations with practitioners of the cooperative economy. These conversations aim to shine a light on the real-world experiences of those involved in co-operatives, and to provide inspiration and resources to those who want to join the democratic economy.

The conversations are hosted by [Ana Ulin](https://anaulin.org), a software engineer whose search for better ways of working together has taken her down the democratic workplace rabbithole.
